## Overview
we are amaking an api which has 3 cities data and are ready to get requeted by making them into a class, once the user input a city name in the front end and search for it the request should be sent using the servers link and query then rendering the data that was responded with nad if the place name entered not in the data, it will give an error.

## Getting Started
making the server codea and info, make sure to know what exactly you want to display so you get it sent from the server to the frontend, make the frontend code to render the data wanted as a website and make sure it can request the data from the server.

## Architecture
i made two file one for the server(using JS, .env, cors, node express) and the other for the frontend(using react, axios, bootstrap)
